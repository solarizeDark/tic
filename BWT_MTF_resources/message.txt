To advertise means to make information public. But nowadays advertising doesn`t limit itself by a word 'publicity'.
Modern advertising has a task to show a product in a positive and pleasant way. It has an aim to make us want to buy it.
But how and when did advertising appear?

The advertisement has existed since antiquity time. At first there were murals that informed about gladiator fights.
In the middle Ages public heralds stood in the centre of the city and gave last news.

In the 15th century there was a good development of printing. After that posters and leaflets appeared.
Two centuries later the first newspapers began to publish advertisements. But it is the XXth century when advertising
really explodes. It followed the invention of radio and TV.

In the United States companies have worked with advertisers since 1930. They invented packaging that had to attract
customers.
They also created an idea of product placement. It means that a product is shown in the movies. After that it gets
well-known and well-sold. For example, it was made with the luxury cars which were shown in James Bond films.

Nowadays the new territory of commercials is Internet with social networks. Small software called cookies allows
offering ads according to the tastes of Internet users. Certainly, in the near future the commercial advertising
will be personalized for each of us.
